Darc is an experimental next generation browser build on xenon and svelte.

Darc combines multiple cutting edge browser UI concepts from arc, stacked browsing, agentic browsers and more. Do not use on origins you don't fully trust as the focus is purely on UI concepts until a v.1 release.

Darc eats as much resources as needed to provide the best UX without any compromise, so expect things like a full blown embedded "elastic search" engine or saving every browser navigation as screenshot and then being able slide through your browsing history as time lapse video. (Expect 10s to 100s of MB per day of usage and 2GB+ memory on fresh start)


# Things to try:

 enable dev mode and open vscode
 enable focus mode to hide the heder tabs giving a feeling of native dev environment
 pinning the logs to the right of vscode to have full kibana for logsearch while developing
 left pinning vsode and having either a scrollable list of webapps or the canvas of the apps on the right. just resize the left vsocde sidebar to fit your needs and it will stay locked while you navigate the webapps working on on the right
