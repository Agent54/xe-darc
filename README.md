# xe-darc
Darc is an experimental next generation browser build on xenon and svelte.

Darc combines multiple cutting edge browser UI concepts from arc, stacked browsing, agentic browsers and more. Do not use on origins you don't fully trust as the focus is purely on UI concepts until a v.1 release.

Darc eats as much resources as needed to provide the best UX without any compromise, so expect things like a full blown embedded "elastic search" engine or saving every browser navigation as screenshot and then being able slide through your browsing history as time lapse video. (Expect 10s to 100s of MB per day of usage and 2GB+ memory on fresh start)
