Power Design Manifesto

Power design is honest.

Power design does not prevent seeing information needed to understand what the system does, how its inner workings interact.

Power design does not assume the user trusts it even in the slightest and acknowledges the burden on itself to prove to the user it is doing what it is claiming to do, not doing what is undesirable, and is in a desired state.

Power design does not assume the user is always paying attention or available, so it enables the trust agreement for anything that happened in the past, with audit trails and infinite persistent undo.

Power design does not belittle users and assume they do not understand how software works.

Power design is still as minimal as possible, hiding or allowing to hide entries to affordances that the user has already learned and does not need constant reminders of their existence.
