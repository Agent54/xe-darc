try:
    --auto-select-desktop-capture-source ⊗	This flag makes Chrome auto-select the provided choice when an extension asks permission to start desktop capture. Should only be used for tests. For instance, --auto-select-desktop-capture-source="Entire screen" will automatically select sharing the entire screen in English locales. The switch value only needs to be substring of the capture source name, i.e. "display" would match "Built-in display" and "External display", whichever comes first. ↪
    --auto-select-screen-capture-source ⊗	This flag makes Chrome auto-select any screen when an extension asks permission to start desktop capture. Should only be used for tests. kAutoSelectDesktopCaptureSource (see above) can be also be used to auto-select screens. But it have the problem that you need to know the name of a screen to auto-select it. The name of screens can't be set, are different for different platforms, and are different if you have one or several screens. So it's hard to use for auto-selecting screens. This flag does not care what the screen name is, but it also gives no control. Any screen could be chosen. It is useful in tests where we don't care which screen is auto-selected. ↪
    --auto-select-tab-capture-source-by-title ⊗	This flag makes Chrome auto-select a tab with the provided title when the media-picker should otherwise be displayed to the user. This switch is very similar to kAutoSelectDesktopCaptureSource, but limits selection to tabs. This solves the issue of kAutoSelectDesktopCaptureSource being liable to accidentally capturing the Chromium window instead of the tab, as both have the same title if the tab is focused. ↪
    --auto-select-window-capture-source-by-title ⊗	This flag makes Chrome auto-select a window with the provided title when the media-picker should otherwise be displayed to the user. This switch is very similar to kAutoSelectDesktopCaptureSource, but limits selection to the window.

add an ainimation to the grid-view container element that does fade in from 0 100 opacity and flies in from scale 2 to scale normal.  the animmation has to be able to be controlled from js so make it react to a tick event that moves it forward by 10% but still run smooth and perfomant as hell not jumpy
now add the trigger to start showing the grid view when hitting the zoom level point in the zoom handling to show tab overview. use zoom out and zoom in events from the handling to set an animation progression on the grid view that progresses in in or out direction depending on zoom direction. start with full transparency and scale of 2 and fade in and zoom in to full size for the grid view and only then trigger the screenshot replacement. DO NOT show animations/transitions when triggereing view mode change from the menu or other ways, only  from the zoom events. make the events progress the ainimation by one ticks so at least 10 events are needed to animate full in and out. also DO NOT animate the individual frames on the grid, animate only the FULL VIEW COMponent

Efficient log handling: Browser logs are written to files that Agent can grep 

Visual feedback with images: Screenshots are integrated directly with the file reading tool, so Agent actually sees the browser state as images rather than relying on text descriptions.

Smart prompts: Agent receives additional context about browser logs, including total line counts and preview snippets,

    It should be something that could be self-hosted or cloud hosted.

    It should be able to be assigned a custom domain.

    It should be able to respond to (at least) the breadth of protocols that a browser uses (http, web sockets, server-sent events, etc)

    It may be able to act as a STUN/TURN server

    It should be able to install some flavor of Web Tiles (packaged, sandboxed, content-addressed, web content)

    These packages would likely come in two flavors: extensions vs tiles.

    Extensions - require more trust and would be able to connect to the outside world, implementing new protocols, directly handling external requests etc.

    Tiles - more like the original proposal. Can only interact with the capabilities it is given. Cannot exfiltrate.

    It should have a digital wallet

    It should have persistent storage capable of handling a variety of storage needs

    It should be able to manage keys and signing operations

    It should be able to act as an ATProto PDS or speak ActivityPub
